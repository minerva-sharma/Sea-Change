    <h2> Petitions that Need Help </h2>

     <br>
     <h2> Action Items </h2>
     <ol> <li> Don’t support companies that abuse animals, even in only some of their products </li>
     <li> Any money you give to a company that tests products on animals or isn’t cruelty-free can be used to fund animal cruelty. </li>
     <li> Cruelty Cutter: scans all the products you buy to tell you which ones aren’t cruelty free. </li>
<li> Be aware that labels often lie: “Not tested on animals” may mean that the finished product is not tested on animals, while ingredients, especially those originating from China where animal testing is legally required, can be tested on animals. </li>
<li> Get involved with nonviolent direct action that supports animal rights. (https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/#about)
Join a rescue organization.</li>
     </ol>
     <h2> Groups </h2>
     <ol>
       <li> Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics:
The Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics has a Leaping Bunny program to let consumers know what products are and are not cruelty-free. The webpage is located here and can be used to find which products are cruelty-free either online or on your phone or device by their handy app. This means when you’re wandering through the store, you can shop with confidence and do a quick check right in the middle of Target to compare which brands are, in fact, cruelty-free. The CCIC has recently urged the U.S. Congress to pass the Humane Cosmetics Act (H.R. 4148). </li>
<li> Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine:
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) is a non-profit based out of Washington D.C. that promotes a vegan diet, preventative medicine, and alternatives to animal research. It was founded in 1985 by Neal D. Barnard and has had support from PETA to further their cause. Most recently, doctors involved have offered a $25,000 grant to end the use of live pigs at the University of Mississippi Medical Center for their physiology course. </li>
<li> Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing:
Johns Hopkins University Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT), established in 1981, is also highly involved in the replacement of animals with in vitro methods in the medical field. They regularly bring together industrial and academic scientists, animal welfare organizations, and the government regulatory community to discuss the issue of animal testing and its possible alternatives. They have also been invited to participate in every U.S. government related activity dealing with alternatives, including the FDA’s Sub-Committee on Toxicology. They are working hard to move us further away from the use of animals in medical and laboratory experiments. Take a moment to check them out and support.

<li> PETA:
The foremost name in animal protection, PETA has a mixed track record that includes larceny, an adoption rate of less than one percent (the rest of the animals are presumably euthanized), funding domestic terrorism and factually inaccurate campaigns. The bottom line: perhaps you can help some of their action items that truly aid animals, but think twice before funding their initiatives.
